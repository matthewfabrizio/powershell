# Rename-Computer

As simple as it sounds.

This script reads in a file called `names.csv`, which is comprised of two columns `OldName` and `NewName`.

## Parameters

When you run the script, there are two mandatory parameters: `Domain` and `Username`.

These are the credentials needed to execute the `Rename-Computer` cmdlet.

## Regards

Originally wrote this for a friend to batch rename computers in a domain. So you might want to change the credential message ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
