This directory contains an example of the `status.log` file the script generates when it is ran.

__NOTE:__ This is not a complete log file, this is just a snippet from a PC I ran this on. I only installed one application and some other parts of the script were executed. See all instances of `Write-LogEntry` to see all that is logged.
